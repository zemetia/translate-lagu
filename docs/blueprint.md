## Core Features:

- Input and Language Detection: Accept song input either as a song title (then search from internet, give several result if any different with same lyric) or lyrics in Indonesian or English.

- Automatic Translation: Automatically detect the input language, and translate to the other one (English <-> Indonesian). Offer two modes of translation: Poetic and Literal.
- Prompt-Based Refinement: Allow users to refine translations by entering prompts for the AI translation tool. For example, the prompter might adjust the 'poetic' translation towards or away from the literal.

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5), reflecting contemplation and reverence.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F1F0FF), a desaturated tint of the primary color.
- Accent color: Golden yellow (#FFC107), positioned analogously and imparting inspiration and joy.
